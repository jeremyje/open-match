/*
This is a sample match function that uses the GRPC harness to set up
the match making function as a service. This sample is a reference
to demonstrate the usage of the GRPC harness and should only be used as
a starting point for your match function. You will need to modify the
matchmaking logic in this function based on your game's requirements.

// makeMatches is where your custom matchmaking logic lives.
// Input:
//  - profile : 'Properties' of a MatchObject specified in the ListMatches or CreateMatch call.
//  - rosters : An array of Rosters. By convention, your input Roster contains players already in
//              the match, and the names of pools to search when trying to fill an empty slot.
//  - pools   : An array PlayerPool messages. Contains all the players returned by the MMLogic API
//              upon querying for the player pools. It already had ignorelists applied as of the
//              time the player pool was queried.
// Output:
//  - (results) JSON blob to populated in the MatchObject 'Properties' field sent to the ListMatches
//              or CreateMatch call.
//  - (rosters) Populated team rosters.  Use is optional but recommended;
//              you'll need to construct at least one Roster with all the players you're selecting
//              as it is used to add those players to the ignorelist. You'll also need all
//              the players you want to assign to your DGS in Roster(s) when you call the
//              BackendAPI CreateAssignments() endpoint.  Might as well put them in rosters now.
//  - error :   Use if you need to return an unrecoverable error.
